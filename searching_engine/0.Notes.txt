mp_index.mat : mp_index file of materials project.

icsd_poscar : ICSD database folder in whith all crystal structure have converted to vasp's POSCAR format

import_poscar.m : Import a VASP POSCAR/CONTCAR file

DirectGap.mat : "DirectGap.mat" show materials of the mp_index with direct energy gaps which are obtained by a web crawler.

PeriodicTable.txt : "PeriodicTable.txt" show the atomic number, ElementSymbol, Pauling electronegativity 
and related parameters of each element in the periodic table.

mp_filter.m : "mp_filter.m" searches the "mp_index.mat" file and prints the mp_index, formula, space group, 
e_above_hull, energy gap, Kcomp, Nsites, and unit cell volume to 'mp_filter_results.txt' 
according to preset conditions from A to F:
         A: formula of allowed elements
         B: have ICSD
         C: Ehull<=0.02
         D: 4<=Kcomp<=6
         E: 0<Egap<=3 eV
         F: have direct band gap
